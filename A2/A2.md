# A2 Architectures

A data stream is a potentially unbounded sequence of events

Events in a data stream can represent monitoring data, sensor measurements, credit card 
transactions, weather station observations, online user interactions, web searches, etc. 
In this section, we are going to learn the concepts of processing infinite streams in 
parallel, using the dataflow programming paradigm.

## What is the difference between latency and throughput?

Latency indicates how long it takes for an event to be processed. Essentially, it is 
the time interval between receiving an event and seeing the effect of processing this 
event in the output.

In data streaming, latency is measured in units of time, such as milliseconds. 
Depending on the application, we might care about average latency, maximum latency, 
or percentile latency.
